                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I’m working as Investigator (DL/ML) at <a href="https://datamachineelite.com" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">Data Machine Elite</a>. I am also enrolled as PhD student enrolled in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.ua.pt/" class="highlight-link" target="_blank"> University of Aveiro</a>, Portugal under a <a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)</a> fellowship with project <a href="https://scion.iyte.edu.tr/candidates" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">SCION </a> funded under <a href="https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en" class="highlight-link" target="_blank"> Horizon Europe </a> by the European Union's.</p>                  
                <p>Previously, I was full-time research scholar (Gen AI) at <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/13526" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">Università Ca'​ Foscari di Venezia </a>. Furthermore, I worked as a Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/agridunya/?originalSubdomain=pk" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">AgriDunya Technologies </a>. I served as a full-time Researcher (DL/ML) during my MS studies at <a href="https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">Tianjin University </a>, China. I had full-time experience of working as Software Programming Instructor at <a href="https://www.iba-suk.edu.pk/" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">Directorate of IBA Community Colleges and Schools</a>. <a href="https://noorcs39.github.io/Nooruddin/Noor_CV.pdf" class="highlight-link" target="_blank">CV</a></p>
                <p>I am currently or potentially interested in the following topics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Learning in 6G Networks:</strong>  What are the potential challenges and solutions for maintaining model accuracy and relevance when applying transfer learning across diverse applications within 6G networks, such as 5G Private Netwokrs?</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Detection in Cellular Networks:</strong> How can ML/DL algorithms be enhanced to improve fault detection accuracy in cellular networks, particularly in identifying subtle and complex network anomalies? What are the most effective techniques for real-time fault detection in cellular networks, and how can these techniques be scaled to handle the increasing complexity of 5G and 6G infrastructures?</li>
                    <li><strong>Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs):</strong> How can we enhance the reliability and safety of generative AI models, particularly LLMs, in producing contextually accurate and unbiased outputs across diverse applications? What strategies can be employed to reduce the computational demands of training large language models while maintaining or improving their performance on complex language tasks?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="highlight">I am actively seeking remote job opportunities as an ML/DL Engineer, Data Scientist, LLM Engineer, or in a related field. If you know of any opportunities that align with my interests, I would greatly appreciate it if you could contact me at noor.cs2@yahoo.com. I am confident that my skills and experience could greatly benefit your team and organization, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further in an interview. Thank you!</p>
